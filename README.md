# PyBer Analysis

This analysis reviews the data for a ride-sharing app named "PyBer". There is a lot of information to digest, but the purpose is straightforward. Namely, we want to see the relationships between area type, driver count, and revenue. Throughout this study we will look to see if there's any surprising trends, outliers and relevant datapoints to inform the allocation of resources for the app. Here's what we'll review:

* Total Revenue per Area Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
* Driver Count (per area)
* Avg Fare per Ride (per area)
* Avg Fare per Driver (per area)
